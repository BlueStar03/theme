# Morning Stroll Through Downtown

I kicked off my city adventure at sunrise, wandering the quiet streets of Downtown. The air was cool and still, punctuated only by the distant hum of early delivery trucks. I passed by the historic clock tower, its hands frozen at 6:45 until recent restoration, and watched as the first café of the day flicked on its neon “Open” sign.

By 9 AM I’d sampled a perfectly brewed cortado at Café Aurora, its caramel sweetness paired with a buttery almond croissant. With coffee in hand, I ambled through the pedestrian plaza, admiring the interplay of light on the glass-paneled office buildings and hearing the soft chatter of street vendors setting up shop.
