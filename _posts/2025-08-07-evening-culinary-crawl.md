# Evening Culinary Crawl

As dusk settled, I embarked on a culinary crawl through the Neon District. My first stop was Taquería Luna—tiny, no-frills, but serving the best al pastor tacos I’ve ever tasted. The caramelized pineapple on top balanced the spicy pork perfectly.

Next I ventured into the lantern-lit alleyways for ramen at Shinobi Ramen, where the broth simmered for 18 hours and arrived steaming in a black stone bowl. Finally, I ended the night with a slice of tarte tatin at Le Petit Pâtissier, its upside-down apple caramel custard closing the evening on a sublime note.
