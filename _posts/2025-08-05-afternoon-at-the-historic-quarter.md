# Afternoon at the Historic Quarter

After lunch, I made my way to the Historic Quarter, where cobblestone lanes wind between centuries-old townhouses. The pastel facades, each trimmed with wrought-iron balconies overflowing with geraniums, felt like stepping into a living watercolor painting.

I spent an hour in the Old City Museum, where a local guide regaled me with tales of the city’s founding—how the river crossing once defined every aspect of life here. Outside, I joined a walking tour of the city walls, scaling stone steps to take in panoramic views from the battlements. The contrast between the modern skyline and this preserved enclave was striking.
